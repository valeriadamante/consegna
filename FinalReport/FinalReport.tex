\section*{REPORT ON THE PhD ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY \textit{Valeria D'Amante}}


The doctoral student Valeria D'Amante, enrolled in the PhD programme in “Fisica Sperimentale” at the University of Siena, cycle XXXVI, carried out the following activities during the PhD course:

\subsection*{RESEARCH ACTIVITIES}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Double Higgs Production (CMS Experiment, CERN, Geneva)}\\
    Conducted an in-depth analysis of resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production ($HH \to b\bar{b}\tau\tau$) using $ \sqrt{s} = 13\,\textrm{TeV} $ proton-proton collision data collected during CMS Run 2. This work focused on the search for resonances in the mass range of 250 GeV to 3 TeV, targeting scenarios predicted by Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories. Developed an independent analysis framework leveraging modern tools specifically tailored for high-energy physics, as ROOT RDataFrames and the Luigi Analysis Workflow (LAW). Contributed to signal and background optimization through advanced machine learning techniques, improving event classification and sensitivity. Performed detailed evaluations of systematic uncertainties and statistical limit extractions, which led to the establishment of upper bounds on Higgs boson pair production cross-sections in both SM and BSM contexts. The results were included in the CMS combined $HH$ analysis published in \textit{Nature}, commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Higgs boson discovery.

    \item \textbf{Machine Learning for Hadronic Tau ($\tau_h$) Identification and Reconstruction (CMS Experiment, CERN)}\\
    Development of the L2TauNNTag algorithm to replace traditional cut-based methods in High-Level Trigger (HLT) paths. Demonstrated improved efficiency and purity in selecting hadronic taus, contributing to Run 3 data-taking.

    % \item \textbf{Measurement of CKM Matrix Elements (CMS Experiment, CERN)}\\
    % Model-independent measurement of the CKM matrix elements $|V_{tq}|$ (where $q = d, s, b$) using single top production in the $t$-channel. Implemented machine learning techniques (DNN and BDT) to enhance signal extraction and top quark identification.

    % \item \textbf{Neutrino-Argon Interactions (SBND Experiment, Fermilab)}\\
    % Analysis of neutrino interaction rates in the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) at Fermilab. Focused on specific final-state topologies to study nuclear effects in neutrino-argon interactions.

    % \item \textbf{Dark Matter Direct Detection Sensitivity (DarkSide-20k, LNGS)}\\
    % Investigated WIMP interactions in liquid argon and xenon detectors, producing exclusion plots under the null-result hypothesis for experiments such as DarkSide-20k and Xenon-1T.

\subsection*{DOCTORAL THESIS}

\noindent\textbf{Title}: Search for resonant double Higgs production in the bb$\tau\tau$ final state at the CMS experiment. \\

\noindent\textbf{Supervisor}: Maria Agnese Ciocci \\

\noindent\textbf{Description of the issues and main results}:
The search for resonant double Higgs production in the $HH \to b\bar{b}\tau\tau$ final state explores the possibility of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) resonances, such as spin-0 or spin-2 particles, decaying into Higgs boson pairs. These resonances are searched for in the mass range of 250 GeV to 3 TeV, using $ \sqrt{s} = 13\,\textrm{TeV} $ proton-proton collision data from CMS Run 2.\\
\textit{Challenges:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Significant background contributions from $t\bar{t}$, $Z + \textrm{jets}$, and single Higgs production.
    \item Limited statistics due to the low $HH$ cross-section.
    \item Accurate reconstruction of hadronically decaying $\tau$-leptons ($\tau_h$).
    \item Systematic uncertainties from detector performance and background modeling.
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textit{Results:}
Optimized selection criteria, including machine learning-based event classifiers, were employed to enhance signal-background separation. A shape-based statistical analysis was performed, placing upper limits on the resonance production cross-section as a function spin and mass of the resonances. Constraints were set on BSM models predicting heavy resonances decaying to $HH$, improving or complementing existing limits in the explored range. A novel analysis framework was developed, enabling efficient data processing and validation.\\
\textit{Impact:}
The advanced techniques for $\tau_h$ reconstruction and event classification developed in this work are essential for probing the Higgs sector with increased data. Even if no significant deviations from Standard Model predictions were observed, the results contribute to ongoing BSM research and pave the way for greater sensitivity in future runs at the LHC.
