    This thesis presents a search for resonant Higgs boson pair production via gluon-gluon fusion ($HH$) and targeting Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios such as the Warped Extra Dimensions (WED) model which predict resonances, including CP-even scalar particles, that enhance the $HH$ production cross section at specific invariant masses. \\
    The search focuses on the $HH \rightarrow b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ final state, with the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system studied through three decay channels: $\tau_h\tau_h$ (fully hadronic) and $\tau_h\tau_\ell$ (semileptonic, with $\ell = e/\mu$). This channel balances signal purity with a branching ratio of 7.3\%, but poses challenges due to neutrinos in $\tau$ decays and background discrimination, requiring advanced reconstruction techniques.

    To perform this search, proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected by the CMS detector during 2016â€“2018 have been used, for a total integrated luminosity of 137.1 fb$^{-1}$.
    A blind analysis approach is employed to avoid biases during the statistical analysis, excluding observed data, and only expected results are reported. Upper limits on the $HH$ production cross section are set as a function of resonance mass and interpreted within the WED framework, offering new insights into potential BSM physics.
