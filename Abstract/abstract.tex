    This thesis presents a search for resonant Higgs boson pairs (HH) production via gluon-gluon fusion (GGF) mechanisms,  predicted by some Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios to be observable with the current dataset collected by the LHC experiments. The search focuses on the $HH\rightarrow b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ final state where one Higgs decays in $b\bar{b}$ quark pair and the other decays in the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ lepton pair. \\
    This final state has a sizeable branching fraction ($BR \rightarrow 7.3\%$) and a quite efficient signature of the H decaying into a $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ pair. However, this channel presents significant challenges due to neutrinos in $\tau$ decays and background discrimination. Advanced techniques are employed for $\tau$ reconstruction and identification, along with sophisticated modeling of the relevant backgrounds. \\
    The $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ pair is studied through three decay channels: $\tau_h \tau_h$ (fully hadronic) and $\tau_h\tau_\ell$, where $\tau_h$  represents a tau lepton decaying into hadrons plus a $\nu_\tau$ , and $\tau_\ell$ corresponds to the leptonic decay of the tau into either an  electron ($\ell = e$) or a  muon ($\ell=\mu$).

    The analysis utilizes data collected by the CMS experiment during the LHC Run II period (2016$-$2018), corresponding to proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 137.1 fb$^{-1}$.
    As part of the CMS internal review process, the analysis remains blinded, meaning that the observed data are not used in the statistical analysis to prevent bias.
    The $95\%$ Confidence Level upper limit on the HH production cross section are set as a function of resonance spin and mass, interpreted within the BSM Warped Extra Dimensions (WED) model for a resonance with a mass in the range from 250 to 3000 GeV for spin 0 and spin 2 hypotheses.
